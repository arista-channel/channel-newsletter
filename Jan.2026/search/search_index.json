Arista's AI networking solutions address this challenge through Cluster Load Balancing (CLB) and the Distributed Etherlink Switch architecture, delivering unprecedented performance for AI and HPC workloads while simplifying network operations.</p> <p>Key Technical Highlights: - Cluster Load Balancing (CLB): Advanced flow-aware load balancing that overcomes the limitations of traditional ECMP and Dynamic Load Balancing by intelligently distributing elephant flows across available paths - Distributed Etherlink Switch: Single-hop architecture for large AI clusters that transforms a leaf-spine topology into a logically unified device, eliminating hashing complexity - Cell-Based Packet Spraying: Innovative approach that divides packets into fixed-size cells and distributes them across all available links for optimal bandwidth utilization - Virtual Output Queuing: Credit-based global queuing system that achieves lossless properties by preventing flow collisions at destination ports</p> <p>Platform Specifications:</p> <p>Arista 7700R4 Series (Distributed Etherlink Switch) -
